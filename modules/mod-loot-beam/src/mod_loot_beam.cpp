/*
 * mod-loot-beam
 *
 * Server half of the wxl-loot-beam client extension: the beacon the client draws over a lootable
 * corpse is tinted by the *server's* view of that corpse's loot, so it is already the right colour
 * before the loot window is ever opened.
 *
 * The stock 3.3.5a client only learns a corpse's loot when loot is requested for it, which is why
 * the extension could originally only colour a body after it had been opened. This module closes
 * that gap without a custom opcode, an addon message or a client patch: at the moment a creature
 * dies its loot has just been rolled, so the best item quality in that loot is written into the
 * corpse's own UNIT_FIELD_PADDING update field. The field is one this core never writes for
 * non-player objects and it lies inside UNIT_END, so the client keeps it in the descriptor block.
 * The extension reads it straight out of that block.
 *
 * One wrinkle: AzerothCore ships UNIT_FIELD_PADDING as UF_FLAG_NONE, so the core's update builder
 * (Object::BuildValuesUpdate, which only sends a field when its flag meets the viewer's visibility)
 * would never put it on the wire and the client would never see the hint. The module promotes the
 * field to UF_FLAG_PUBLIC in the core's runtime flag table at load (the array is non-const), so the
 * one unused padding dword rides along on every unit update. That is why no core source edit is
 * needed: the fix is a write to UnitUpdateFieldFlags[], not a patch.
 *
 * Encoding: the best item quality (0..7) is stored as quality + 1, so the untouched default of 0
 * means "no server hint" and the client falls back to the loot it learns when the window opens.
